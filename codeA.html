<h1>Explanation:</h1>
<ul>
<li>The LDR is used to detect ambient light intensity. Depending on the intensity, the Arduino will decide whether to turn the lights on or off.</li>
<li>The relay module is used to control the external light source (LED strip or light bulb).</li>
<li>In the code, the threshold value (500 in this case) determines when the lights should turn on or off.</li>
<li>You may need to adjust this value based on your environment.</li>
<li>The delay is added for stability and to prevent rapid switching of the lights.</li>
